# 🎲 Texas Hold'em Poker (C++ Console Game)

A simple **single-player Texas Hold’em Poker game** written in C++.  
This project deals cards, reveals the flop/turn/river, and lets the player fold, call, or raise during each betting round.  
It’s built as a **practice project** for learning object-oriented C++ and game logic.
There is an error in this program where the random cards are out of range. I have no clue how to fix it, but the code works as expected after running it
